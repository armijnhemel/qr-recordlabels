This is a small program to generate labels from Discogs CSV dumps, with the unique Discogs URL as a QR code.

These labels can be used by for example record stores or dealers at a record fair to mark records. Users could then simply scan the QR code and be taken to the appropriate Discogs page if, of course, the information has been correctly entered ("garbage in, garbage out").

A few notes:

* the labels are generated for a particular label layout (A4, 3 columns, 8 rows) because those are the only labels that I have available right now
* only Discogs collection CSV dumps can be processed, not any of the other lists
* depending on your printer some of the labels might not be printed correctly. This is because some printers cannot print borderless
